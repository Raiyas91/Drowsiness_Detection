# Drowsiness_Detection
This a python based Drowsiness Detection System.The majority of accidents happen due to the drowsiness of the driver. So, to prevent these accidents I built a system  which will detect if the person sitting in front of the camera is feeling drowsy,if yes then a alaraming sound will be played which will alert the driver.

I built the system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras. I used pretrained models to get facial landmarks and do the prediction.
